# hello-world
Not sure what to write here.
I'm procrastinating the quick completion of a sewing project because I want to feel like I'm actually learning this coding stuff so I can be over stressed out and justified for drinking wine later.  
Too deep?  
Probably not what this step was asking me to write about.
